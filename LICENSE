Modification overview
In principle, the original software (distributed by Redsolution LTD.) was redesigned to serve the purpose of internal

- use of only one XMPP account (original related classes have been kept and slightly modified)
- use of predetermined xmpp server
- ability to self register user accounts
- added server-specific function for creating MUC rooms between selected user contacts
- auto-creation and joining of predetermined MUC global rooms acting as forum spaces and for sending notices to users
- added server-specific function for updating user profile information, uploading of avatar picture and changing of password
- separated view for viewing current and previous chats
- removed some unused resources and source code - graphic resources, translations, popular xmpp client settings etc.
- changes GUI related elements - colors, backgrounds, some gui elements etc.
- added simple server-specific checks for server online
